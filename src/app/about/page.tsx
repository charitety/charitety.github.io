      <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.5' }}>Hello, my name is Caridad. I hold a Bachelor of Architecture from the
        Universidad Aut√≥noma de Santo Domingo and a Master of Science in
        Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship from the University of
        Portsmouth. After more than a decade working primarily with non-profits
        and collaborating with different stakeholders to bring solutions to
        disfrancised communities in the United States and abroad, I decided to
        make a major change in my career to another field I am passionate about:
        technology.<br /><br />I have always liked technology, but I only started studying it
          formally in the summer of 2022 when I was admitted to The Knowledge
          House Innovation Fellowship as a data science fellow and started
          learning Python. In April 2023, I got accepted into the Step It Up
          Program. I am a software development apprentice with Xpanxion UST.
          During my training I have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, React,
          Node.js and Python. In this period I have also developed my
          communication skills and used business analysis tools such as SQL and
          PowerBI.<br /><br />I am looking forward to getting my first assignment in the field!<br /><br />
